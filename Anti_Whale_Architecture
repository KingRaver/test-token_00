Anti-Whale Architecture:

1. Purchase & Holding Limits
- Maximum single wallet holdings: 1% of total supply (10M tokens)
- Progressive taxation on large purchases:
  * 0-100k tokens: No tax
  * 100k-500k: 2% tax
  * 500k-1M: 5% tax
  * >1M: 10% tax
- Collected taxes go to community treasury

2. Time-Based Restrictions
- Large purchases (>100k tokens) require:
  * 7-day spread of buys
  * 48-hour delay between significant purchases
  * Minimum 30-day holding before governance rights
  * Vesting schedule for purchases >500k tokens

3. Smart Contract Implementation:
```solidity
// Anti-whale mechanics
mapping(address => uint256) public lastPurchaseTime;
mapping(address => uint256) public totalHoldings;

function calculatePurchaseTax(uint256 amount) public pure returns (uint256) {
    if (amount <= 100000 * 10**18) return 0;
    if (amount <= 500000 * 10**18) return amount * 2 / 100;
    if (amount <= 1000000 * 10**18) return amount * 5 / 100;
    return amount * 10 / 100;
}

function purchase(uint256 amount) external {
    require(
        block.timestamp >= lastPurchaseTime[msg.sender] + 48 hours,
        "Purchase too soon"
    );
    require(
        totalHoldings[msg.sender] + amount <= maxHolding,
        "Exceeds max holding"
    );
   
    uint256 tax = calculatePurchaseTax(amount);
    // Transfer logic with tax
}
```

4. Governance Power Limitations:
- Voting power caps:
  * Maximum 1% voting power per address
  * Quadratic voting implementation
  * Time-weighted voting power
- Proposal restrictions:
  * Multiple signatures required for large proposals
  * Cooling period between proposals
  * Stake required proportional to impact

5. Liquidity Protection:
- Maximum LP token holding: 5% per address
- LP removal limitations:
  * 72-hour timelock
  * Maximum 20% removal per week
  * Emergency circuit breakers

6. Detection & Prevention Systems:
- Sybil attack prevention:
  * Address clustering analysis
  * Transaction pattern monitoring
  * Historical behavior tracking
- Flash loan protection:
  * Block-based governance checks
  * Time-weighted average positions
  * Snapshot mechanics

7. Dynamic Adjustment System:
```solidity
struct WhaleParameters {
    uint256 maxHolding;
    uint256 purchaseDelay;
    uint256 votingPowerCap;
    uint256 taxTier1;
    uint256 taxTier2;
    uint256 taxTier3;
}

WhaleParameters public params;

function adjustParameters(uint256 totalSupply) internal {
    params.maxHolding = totalSupply / 100; // 1%
    params.votingPowerCap = totalSupply / 100;
    // Other dynamic adjustments
}
```

8. Enforcement Mechanisms:
- Automated enforcement:
  * Smart contract restrictions
  * Real-time monitoring
  * Automatic transaction reversions
- Manual oversight:
  * DAO emergency committee
  * Community reporting system
  * Governance intervention rights
