LP NFT Structure:
1. Three Tiers of LP Position NFTs
- Seed Tier (20 NFTs)
  * 10 ETH each = 200 ETH
  * Represents 15% of LP rights
  * 12-month lock minimum
  * Early governance but capped voting power

- Builder Tier (40 NFTs)
  * 5 ETH each = 200 ETH
  * Represents 25% of LP rights
  * 9-month lock minimum
  * Balanced governance weight

- Community Tier (100 NFTs)
  * 2 ETH each = 200 ETH
  * Represents 60% of LP rights
