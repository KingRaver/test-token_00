I've created a comprehensive Snapshot voting implementation that incorporates GTC, GIV, and TREE tokens. Here are the key features of this implementation:

1. Token Integration
- Supports all three governance tokens (GTC, GIV, and TREE)
- Calculates total voting power by combining balances from all tokens
- Displays individual token balances and total voting power

2. Voting Mechanism
- Token-weighted voting system where voting power scales with token holdings
- Three voting options: For, Against, and Abstain
- Single-choice voting to prevent double voting
- Real-time vote tracking and display

3. User Interface
- Clean, professional design using shadcn/ui components
- Wallet connection interface
- Clear display of voting power and token balances
- Real-time vote results visualization
- Proposal status and deadline tracking

4. Security Features
- Wallet connection requirement before voting
- Vote recording to prevent multiple votes
- Transaction state management
- Clear feedback on vote status
